          I was born on April 8, 2001, in Manzanillo. Since I was little, I've always been interested in computers and technology in general. I first became interested in computer science in high school, attending "JovenClub" in my town, tinkering and asking questions about anything I could think of. In eleventh grade, I participated in a computer science competition, competing with other students to build an app using Visual Basic. That was my first encounter with programming.

          One of my greatest motivations is learning. This is what motivated me to study at the University of Informatics Sciences (UCI), where I began searching for books and tutorials that increasingly drew me deeper into the world of programming. Since then, I haven't stopped learning, and my love for technology continues to grow.
          <br> <br>
          I'm currently a front-end developer with over three years of experience. One of my core competencies is CSS animations. I have a background in graphic design, which I apply to creating UX/UI for my applications. I'm passionate about building functional websites through best development practices.
